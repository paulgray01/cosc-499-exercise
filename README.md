## Feature Function

My 2 features are a function to get the **sum** of a user's input of positive integers, and a function to get the **product** of a user's input of positive integers. The user will be able to input however many of positive integers they want, and then choose whether to get the sum or product of those numbers.
summation(): Will add all the numbers together and return the sum
product(): Will multiply all the numbers together and return the product

## How to Use

After running the python file in the command line, you will be prompted to enter any number of positive integers, and to enter after each number. To complete your stream of numbers, enter 0.
You will then be prompted to choose whether to get the SUM of the numbers, or the PRODUCT. Entering either will result in the answer being returned.
